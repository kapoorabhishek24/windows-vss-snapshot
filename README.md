# Enabling Windows VSS Snapshot using AWS Systems Manager

This proof-of-concept is based on an [AWS Management Tools Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/take-microsoft-vss-enabled-snapshots-using-amazon-ec2-systems-manager/) written by Purvi Goyal. I followed the well written blog and created a terraform template based on it. There are few things that you may not require, I just tried to automate what was conveyed in the blog.

**Note: Please specify the desired variables and feel free to extend the template as required.**
